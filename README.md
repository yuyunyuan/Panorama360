# Panorama360
## Introduction
A 360-degree image is a controllable panoramic photo that surrounds the original point
from which the video was taken.
A 360-degree image is not only effective for showing off vistas, internal architecture,
also show the dramatic fashion. Therefore, effectively replicate the experience of being
there. Now some smartphone applications can provide this technology which will assist
users to finish the construction of 360 panoramas, or even spherical panoramas.
## Objectives
Design and implement n program to create a 360-degree
panoramic photo from a short video which is taken by photographic equipment. In
general, we have two primary outcomes: a full 360-degree panorama and a rectangle
image cropped.
Firstly, program can read the video and select some important image frames.
Secondly, it can detect ISFT, match these ISFT points with key-frames and create
Finally, program can bend the neighboring frames, blend the pixel color and reduce
color distortion. repeat the above steps to complete 360 panoramas and output
the result in the form of a rectangle image.
